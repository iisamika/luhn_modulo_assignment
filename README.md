# luhn_modulo_assignment

Basically the same assignment but this time instead of using clunky looking if statement I am now using a slightly less clunky looking if
statement. Also I removed the switch case and replaced it with object literal list and as requested I am now using abstraction in the
functions. Though I have to admit about the abstraction that I haven't done abstraction before this so I am not entirely sure that I am
using it correctly.
